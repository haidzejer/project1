# Card Counting
## This is a boring game to learn to count cards! :D

One player at a time, the player will attempt to guess the current count of the cards that have been displayed so far.  
The players will need to take a moment to look at the rules of the Hi-Opt-I card counting system if they are unfamiliar with how it works.

###Technologies Used
---
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery library. 


###How to Play
___
* Press Start
* Select the number(from the dropdown) that represents what you think the current count is at
* The cards being displayed will not change until you get the count correct
* Try to get through as many card pairs as possible beofore time runs out

###Future Features
---
1.  Add multiple card counting systems to pick from
2.  Add option for multiple hands dealt at one time
3.  Add version that switches between players after each guess

I used the [Fisher-Yates Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)

I was assisted by Phillippe Luchansky, Jimmy Garzon, and the students at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program in Santa Monica.
